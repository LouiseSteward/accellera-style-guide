# 2. Project setup
{:.page-break-before}

This chapter explains the project setup and use of the GitHub repository for technical documentation.

## 2.1 GitHub repository setup

It is recommended to use a dedicated GitHub repository to develop a single standard book. Please contact the Technical Committee chair to request a new repository for the technical documentation. After this, a new GitHub repository will be created, including the installation of default templates and scripts to generate an IEEE-SA stylesheet compatible standards document.

[Table 1](#table-1) below gives an overview of the default structure of the repository.

{% include table
   markdown="

| Directory      | Purpose / Content                            | Remarks                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `_api/`        | API to fetch metadata and content in JSON    | Currently not supported      | 
| `_app/`        | Template files for app output                | Not touched by technical editor(s) |
| `_configs/`    | Configuration settings for different outputs | Customization by doc team |
| `_data/`       | Project (meta)data and settings e.g.,<br>`settings.yml`, `locales.yml` | Not touched by technical editor(s) |
| `_data/works/standard/` | Metadata of the standards document in YAML (`default.yml`) | Used by technical editor(s)  |
| `_doc/`        | This documentation                           | Not touched by technical editor(s) |
| `_epub/`       | Template files for epub output               | Not touched by technical editor(s) |
| `_includes/`   | HTML templates to render the document        | Not touched by technical editor(s) |
| `_layouts/`    | Templates to structure pages                 | Not touched by technical editor(s) |
| `_output/`     | Output directory for PDFs and epubs          | Used by technical editor(s)        |
| `_sass/`       | Location to store default document styles    | Not touched by technical editor(s) |
| `_site/`       | Subdirectory for web and app versions of the document | Not touched by technical editor(s) |
| `_tools/`      | Flow documentation utilities                 | Not touched by technical editor(s) |
| `assets/`      | Styles and images for the project            | Not touched by technical editor(s) |
| `standard/`    | Subdirectory for the standard document        | Used by technical editor(s)        |

In addition, the root directory also contains some configuration settings to enable flow installation, automation and/or deployment. Normally technical editor(s) do not have to change these files.

## 2.2 Standard document creation

The directory to store the standard document is called `standard`. This directory will contain the document source files in markdown format. The metadata of the standard document is located in directory `_data/works/standard/`.

[Table 2](#table-2) below gives an overview of the relevant directories and files for the technical editing.

{% include table
   markdown="

| File / directory                   | Purpose / Content        |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `_data/works/standard/default.yml` | Metadata of the document |
| `standard/images/`                 | Location to store images |
| `standard/styles/`                 | Location for stylesheets |
| `standard/index.md`                | Landing page (e.g. cover) for the standard document |
| `standard/package.opf`             | Placeholder to generate epub output (do not edit or remove) |
| `standard/toc.ncx`                 | Placeholder to generate navigation file for old ereaders (do not edit or remove) |

## 2.3 Tool setup

[Annex A](a.html) explains the installation of a virtual machine, the Xubuntu operating system, and the packages required to publish documents. 

Note that this tool setup is only required for the publication of standard documents, which is the responsibility of the technical editor. 

For document editing and authoring, access to the GitHub project and availability of a simple ASCII editor is sufficient.
