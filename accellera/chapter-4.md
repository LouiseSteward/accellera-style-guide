{:.page-break-before}

This chapter explains the document structure and style to be compliant with the IEEE SA Standards Style Manual.

## 4.1 Frontmatter

The frontmatter of an Accellera standard is considered informative, which means it is not officially part of the standard. The frontmatter of a standard includes pages in the following order:

1. Cover page
2. Title page
3. Abstract page
4. Notice page
5. Participants page
6. Table of contents

All pages except the cover page are mandatory. The page numbers of the abstract, notice and participants page shall use Western Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.). The cover and title page shall not have page numbers.

### 4.1.1 Front cover page

The front cover page is optional for Accellera standard documents. It often shows the identity of the standards developing organization using a graphical representation. It also includes the name of the standard, its version, and the working group who developed the standard. The cover page is the first element in the PDF bookmarks.

### 4.1.2 Title page

The title page is mandatory and contains the following information:

* Accellera logo
* Title and version of the Accellera standard
* Date when the standard is released

Draft standards for public review shall contain the label **Draft** at the title page. The title page is the second element in the PDF bookmarks.

### 4.1.3 Abstract page

The abstract page is mandatory and contains the following information:

* Abstract section
* Keywords section
* Acknowledgement section (if applicable)
* Copyright statement

The abstract paragraph gives a short explanation of the standard written in the passive voice and should be no longer than 15 lines. It is followed by a paragraph listing the key terms and phrases from the text of the standard, and should at least specify the name or abbreviation of the standard. The keywords should match the keywords as defined in the PDF properties. If applicable, a Acknowledgement section can be added to recognize specific contributions of individuals or organizations. The copyright statement lists the name of the organization owning the copyright of the standard document. The abstract page is *not* part of the PDF bookmarks.

### 4.1.4 Notice page

The notice page is mandatory and briefly explains the context and governance of the standards developing organization to how the standard should be interpreted and used. It also contains the address of the standards developing organization, in the form of email, postal or web address, to encourage receiving suggestions and feedback. The notice page is the third element in the PDF bookmarks.

### 4.1.5 Participants page

The participants page is mandatory and lists the the officers and members of the working group that developed the standard. It is recommended to list the full first names and not the initials. Titles (e.g., Dr., Ms., P.E.) should not be included as part of the full name.
The list of eligible voting member organizations is added to the participants page, and based on the working group participation and contribution to the ballot. The participants pages is included in the PDF bookmarks.

### 4.1.8 Table of contents

The table of contents is mandatory and lists the first-level clauses (one digit notation) and nested second-level subclauses (two digit notation). Lower level clauses are optional and the working group may decide to use subclauses down to the 6th level.
Lists of tables and figures not required in the table of contents. For lengthy documents however, inclusion of a lists of tables and figures is recommended.The table of contents is included in the PDF bookmarks.

## 4.2 Document body

The body of document contains the normative text of the standard, unless otherwise stated. The document body shall at least contain the following ordered clauses:

> 1&#46; Overview

> 2&#46; Normative references

> 3&#46; Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations

### 4.2.1 Overview

The overview clause is mandatory and shall at least contain the following ordered subclauses:

> 1&#46;1 Scope

> 1&#46;2 Purpose

> 1&#46;3 Word usage

The scope of the standard explains what is covered in the standard and, if necessary, what is not covered in the standard. The purpose explains why the standard is needed. Although the purpose subclause is not mandatory for IEEE-SA standards, it is considered important for Accellera standards and therefore recommended to include. The Word usage clause defines the usage of the words *shall*, *should*, and *may* in the standard.

The overview clause may include additional subclauses that the working group considers relevant. The overview shall not contain any detailed technical description of the standard, as this shall be described in separate clauses (from Clause 4 onwards). Furthermore, the overview shall not list the contents of the standard, for this a table of contents is included.

### 4.2.2 Normative references

Clause 2 in a standard document shall list the normative references. Normative references are references to other standard documents which shall be followed or applied as part of the standard definition and usage. The clause shall not contain references to material which is considered informative. For this, an informative bibliography clause could be included.

### 4.2.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations

Clause 3 in a standard document shall list the definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations used in the standard. The following subclauses shall be defined:

> 3&#46;1 Definitions

> 3&#46;2 Acronyms and abbreviations

The definitions clause lists all definitions used in the standard. Each definition should contain a concise, self-contained description of the term and shall not contain any other information, such as requirements or elaborative text. The term should not be used in its own definition. A definition may reference to other definitions.

Acronyms and abbreviations are listed in alphanumeric order. Each acronym and abbreviation is followed by the full term. Within text, the acronym or abbreviation should follow the first use of the full term (the first time in the introduction, then the first time in the body of the document, and then the first time in any annexes in which the acronym appears). The abbreviation or acronym should be placed in parentheses when following the full term. 

### 4.2.4 Numbering clauses and subclauses

All clause and subclause headings should consist of a number and a concise, meaningful, title. The numbering shall use Western Arabic numerals in sequence. The number of a clause (first-level) shall contain a number followed by a decimal point. A second-level subclause should be numbered by adding a number to the clause number (e.g., 5.1). For third-level subclauses and below, an additional decimal point and number is added (e.g., 5.1.1).
